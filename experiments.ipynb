      "1. Introduction\n",
      "There are many thousand kinds of proteins with different properties and functions in a cell.\n",
      "To study a protein, one has to obtain the highly purified intact form of the protein. A major\n",
      "protein is not so difficult to be purified while a minor one may need many purification steps\n",
      "and high skills on the techniques. This chapter describes the principles underlying\n",
      "techniques for separation and purification of proteins extracted from cells and tissues. The\n",
      "strategy involves extraction and purification.\n",
      "2. Extraction of protein\n",
      "Generally both extraction and purification processes should be done under a cold\n",
      "condition, mostly at 0-4oC, except for some proteins. An ice box or another cooling system\n",
      "is normally needed for sample cooling. The extraction procedure varies according to the\n",
      "type of sample and physicochemical properties of the protein. The first step is to disrupt\n",
      "cells or tissues. The more gentle procedure is used the more intact protein is obtained.\n",
      "Most of animal cells and tissues are soft and easy to break, so gentle methods can be\n",
      "applied. For bacteria, fungi and most plant cells which have tough cell envelope, more\n",
      "vigorous procedures are required. Extraction buffer or solvent is also important. Buffer\n",
      "with suitable concentration, ionic strength, and pH is used for extraction of water-soluble\n",
      "protein. In some case, mild detergent or other appropriate dissociating substance is added\n",
      "to the extraction buffer. Protease inhibitors are sometimes necessary to prevent\n",
      "destruction of the extracted proteins by proteases. From the fact that the protein extract\n",
      "obtained from subcellular component has contaminants less than that obtained from\n",
      "whole cell and will be easier to be purified. So separation of subcellular components may\n",
      "be done before the protein extraction. Disruption of cells should be adjusted to get intact\n",
      "sub-cellular components. The required cell component is obtained by centrifugation\n",
      "under appropriate condition.\n",
      "2.1 Extraction of water-soluble protein from animal cells and tissues\n",
      "The proteins which are components of fragile unicellular tissues such as animal blood\n",
      "cells can be extracted by using hypotonic buffer solution. If the sample contains different\n",
      "types of cells, separation of the cell types before the extraction will make the purification\n",
      "easier. This osmosis-based method is also used for animal cells grown in culture media. In\n",

      "some case a mild surfactant is included in the extraction buffer. Sonication or freeze/thaw\n",
      "cycle or a mild mechanical agitation may be used to help disruption of the cells and\n",
      "dissociation of the cellular components. For multicellular soft tissue, a hand homogenizer\n",
      "(Fig. 1) or an electrical one with optimal size is a good choice. The tiny pestle using with a\n",
      "micro-centrifuge tube is also commercially available for the sample with a small volume.\n",
      "Equipments with stronger breaking power such as a blade blender are needed for\n",
      "extraction of proteins from tougher tissue such as animal muscle. Cell disruption by\n",
      "nitrogen decompression is another method for animal cells and some plant cells. In this\n",
      "method, large quantities of nitrogen are dissolved in the cells under high pressure in a\n",
      "vessel. When the pressure is suddenly released, the dissolved nitrogen becomes bubbles.\n",
      "The expanding bubbles cause rupture of the cell. Intact organelles are also obtained by\n",
      "this method.\n",
      "Fig. 1. Homogenization of tissue by a hand homogenizer.\n",
      "2.2 Extraction of water-soluble protein from unicellular organisms\n",
      "This group of organisms includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and some algae. Their cell envelopes\n",
      "are tougher than those of animal cells. The stronger methods are needed for disruption of\n",
      "the cells. A simple method is to shake the suspension of cells, as well as spores, with small\n",
      "glass beads or the other kind of beads. If the collision with the beads is done in a blender,\n",
      "the method is called a bead mill. Sonication is another way to break the cells. The solution\n",
      "used to suspend the cells can be only an appropriate buffer, or with the addition of some\n",
      "enzyme and/or mild detergent. The examples of the enzymes are lysozyme, cellulase and\n",
      "chitinase. Nonionic and zwitterionic detergents, especially Triton X-100 and CHAPS (3-[(3-\n",

      "This chapter aims to highlight the difficulties encountered during the purification of native\n",
      "cellular and membrane-bound enzymes from whole cell extracts. There are many reasons\n",
      "for wanting to purify enzymes, such as to fully characterize them or to mass produce them\n",
      "for commercial purposes. Regardless of the reason for wanting to purify an enzyme, the\n",
      "general extraction and purification procedures are essentially the same. However,\n",
      "depending on the properties of the enzyme, certain modifications of the methods must be\n",
      "considered regarding specific problems that can be encountered throughout the process,\n",
      "such as enzyme insolubility and loss of enzyme activity. Although several classic and more\n",
      "modern methods are available to solve these kinds of challenges, the enzyme purification\n",
      "step remains a major challenge for any method of extraction used.\n",
      "We will present the general aspects of enzyme purification, followed by a specific example of\n",
      "the problems we encountered and attempted to resolve in the purification of the autolysin\n",
      "PA49.5 from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. Autolysins are bacteriolytic enzymes that digest\n",
      "the peptidoglycans of bacterial cell walls (Dako et al, 2008). In several studies it was found that\n",
      "autolysins are linked to lipids or other membranous components during the extraction process\n",
      "and especially during the purification. Since they are very closely linked to the cell walls, their\n",
      "purification presents major challenges associated with their low concentration, their\n",
      "insolubility and the retention of their biological activity (Marshak et al., 1996; Brown et al.,\n",
      "1970). Among these difficulties, their insolubility during purification remains by far the most\n",
      "serious and examples of how we tried to resolve this problem will be presented.\n",
      "We can look at the process of enzyme purification as a series of steps, each one sequentially\n",
      "enhancing the level of purification from a crude extract. It is essential to minimize protein\n",
      "losses throughout the process; therefore the use of fewer steps during the purification is\n",
      "important since losses can occur in every step due, for example, to linking to separation\n",
      "matrices, insolubilities, or losses into the fringe fractions during separation procedures. We\n",
      "will look at the general steps in the extraction of proteins from the cells, the clarification of\n",

      "with antibodies. The antibody assays however do not necessarily indicate if the enzyme is in\n",
      "an active conformation. The assays based on catalytic activity do however require that the\n",

      "the extractions buffers contain compounds such as detergents that denature the\n",
      "tridimensional structure of the enzyme. Compounds compatible with enzyme assays must\n",
      "therefore be used to minimize losses of activity. The isolation of certain types of enzymes\n",
      "may present problems specific to those enzymes. For example, some problems most often\n",
      "associated with the purification of membrane proteins are that they require organic solvents\n",
      "or detergents for their solubilization. Also, insoluble enzymes may require the use of\n",
      "stronger chaotropic compounds such as lithium chloride or guanidine HCL that can in turn\n",
      "inactivate the enzyme. In order to be able to fully characterize the biochemical properties of\n",
      "a purified enzyme, it must be completely free of contaminants such as cell wall or cell\n",
      "membrane components, nucleic acids or other proteins. The complete removal of\n",
      "contaminants is, therefore, the primary objective of the purification. These contaminants can\n",
      "interfere with subsequent purification steps or with enzyme activity assays. The purity of an\n",
      "enzyme extraction can be confirmed, for example, by the presence of a single band on an\n",

      "Once the cell or tissue homogenate is produced, the cell debris and other insoluble\n",

      "differential precipitations can be performed to progressively remove cell debris in order to\n",
      "rehomogenize it to enhance protein yield or to isolate specific cell organelles if the starting\n",
      "material is eukaryotic. Following this clarification, the cell extract is then ready to be\n",
      "purified in an enrichment or concentration procedure.\n",
      "A process that can be considered after the clarification is the concentration of the enzyme\n",

      "concentrate the extract. Lyophilisation, or freeze-drying, has the advantage of protecting the\n",
      "protein from the chemical reactions that can damage the proteins in an aqueous solution,\n",
      "such as aggregation, precipitation and protease degradation (O’Fagain 2004). The protein\n",

      "There are two applications of ammonium sulfate precipitation. The first one is a complete\n",
      "precipitation in which all proteins are precipitated by the addition of the salt. The proteins\n",
      "are recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in a minimal volume of water and are\n",
      "therefore concentrated. The residual salt must be removed by dialysis as it can interfere with\n",
      "protein activity or subsequent purification steps. One of the problems encountered with the\n",
      "dialysis of a protein extract is that the protein can precipitate onto the walls of the dialysis\n",
      "tubing thereby impairing the passage of particles across the membrane. This would be\n",
      "particularly problematic in the dialysis of a crude cell extract (Doonan, 2004a). The salts\n",
      "cause the precipitation of proteins by removing water from the hydrophobic patches on the\n",
      "protein’s surface, thus rendering them insoluble (Doonan, 2004b). Another approach to the\n",
      "concentration of a cell extract is a fractional precipitation using a salt. Again ammonium\n",
      "sulfate is the most frequently used salt, because of its high solubility and the fact that the\n",
      "density of saturated solutions is less that of the protein. This allows the collection of proteins\n",
      "by centrifugation (Doonan, 2004b). The fractional precipitation is done by incrementally\n",
      "adding amounts of ammonium sulfate and collecting the fractions precipitated by various\n",
      "salt concentrations by centrifugation. Fractions can, for example, be collected at each\n",
      "increment of 20% concentration of salt. Each fraction can be analyzed for the enzyme in\n",
      "question. This will therefore concentrate the cell extract and also begin the process of\n",
      "purification. Depending on the solubility of the protein it may however be found in more\n",

      "This section deals with the three major functions of NAMPT: growth factor, cytokine and\n",
      "nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase. Accumulating evidence suggests that NAMPT can\n",
      "function as a growth factor or a cytokine though the underlying molecular mechanisms\n",
      "remain to be established. It is beyond dispute that NAMPT can function as a nicotinamide\n",
      "phosphoribosyltransferase.\n",
      "2.1 Growth factor\n",
      "Growth factor generally refers to a naturally occurring protein capable of stimulating cellular\n",
      "growth, proliferation and differentiation. Growth factors are important for regulating a variety\n",
      "of cellular processes. Several studies indicate that NAMPT may function as a growth factor.\n",
      "Samal et al. (1994) first found that NAMPT can enhance significantly the number of pre-B-cell\n",
      "colonies derived from normal human or mouse bone marrow by at least 70% in the presence of\n",
      "both IL-7 and stem cell factor. Thus, the authors first named this protein as pre-B-cell colony\n",
      "enhancing factor. Van der Veer et al. (2005) reported that NAMPT can promote vascular\n",
      "smooth muscle cell maturation. Human smooth muscle cells transduced with the NAMPT\n",
      "gene had enhanced survival. Fukuhara and co-workers (2005) proposed NAMPT as a visfatin,\n",
      "an adipokine produced by visceral fat that can engage and activate the insulin receptor (IR).\n",
      "Although this original publication was retracted (Fukuhara et al., 2007) because of questions\n",
      "regarding the reproducibility of the NAMPT/IR interaction from different preparations of\n",
      "recombinant NAMPT protein, Xie et al. found that NAMPT exerts an insulin-like activity as a\n",
      "growth factor for osteoblasts. They noticed that the effects of NAMPT, such as glucose uptake,\n",
      "proliferation, and type I collagen enhancement in cultured human osteoblast-like cells, bore a\n",
      "close resemblance to those of insulin and were inhibited by hydroxy-2-\n",
      "naphthalenylmethylphosphonic acid tris-acetoxymethyl ester (HNMPA-[AM]3), a specific\n",
      "inhibitor of IR tyrosine kinase activity (Xie et al., 2007).\n",
      "2.2 Cytokine\n",
      "Cytokine is sometimes used interchangeably among scientists with the term growth factor.\n",
      "The term cytokine encompasses a large and diverse family of polypeptide regulators that\n",
      "are produced widely throughout the body by cells of diverse embryological origin. Their\n",
      "actions may be grouped as autocrine, paracrine and endocrine. NAMPT may be added to\n",
      "the list of cytokines. The first NAMPT cDNA was screened out using a degenerate\n",
      "oligonucleotide probe designed on the basis of the similarity in the coding sequences of five\n",
      "different cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-13), at the signal peptidase processing\n",

      "cytokines (Samal et al., 1994). Ognjanovic and colleagues reported that recombinant\n",
      "human NAMPT (rhNAMPT) treatment of WISH cells and fetal membrane explants\n",
      "significantly increased IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression (Ognjanovic et al., 2001; Ognjanovic\n",

      "al. (2008) demonstrated that rhNAMPT functions as a direct rat neutrophil chemotactic\n",

      "It is well-known that many proteins fold into unique 3D structure (Anfinsen & Scheraga,\n",
      "1975; Pain, 2000). The mechanisms by which an amino acid chain forms a complicated\n",
      "tertiary structure have been studied extensively (Sato et al,, 2006; Sato & Fersht, 2007; Sosnick\n",
      "& Barrick, 2011; Schaeffer & Daggett, 2011) but are still not understood in a comprehensive\n",
      "way (Bowman et al., 2011). It is well-recognized that all information on the 3D structure of a\n",
      "protein is coded in its amino acid sequence (Anfinsen & Scheraga, 1975; Pain, 2000). Hence\n",
      "we should be able to extract the information from the sequence. However, this is a\n",
      "significant, long-standing and unsolved problem in structural bioinformatics. Gross features\n",
      "of protein 3D structures or protein folds are characterized by some combination of\n",
      "secondary structural elements, and the ways of combination of secondary units are full of\n",
      "variety (Lesk, 2010). This situation does not allow us to construct a simple picture of the\n",
      "protein folding mechanisms. Among such a variety of protein folds, frequently appearing\n",
      "common folds, so-called superfolds (Orengo et al., 1994), are attractive targets for studying\n",
      "their folding mechanisms. The crucial point is that in general the fold of proteins tends to be\n",
      "more conservative than their sequences, i.e., sometimes proteins sharing the same fold show\n",
      "low sequence homology (Orengo et al., 1994; Jennings & Wright, 1993, Cavagnero et al.,\n",
      "1999; Nishimura et al., 2000). This fact implies the difficulty in approaching this problem\n",
      "using standard bioinformatics techniques such as multiple alignment techniques and so on.\n",
      "We have been investigating this problem for several proteins using inter-residue average\n",
      "distance statistics of proteins. The tool we introduced is a kind of predicted contact map\n",
      "constructed from the sequence of a protein disregarding the knowledge of its 3D structure.\n",
      "We call this map the Average Distance Map (ADM) (Kikuchi et al., 1988; Kikuchi, 2002;\n",

      "The folding scenario of a protein may be like the following. One or several portions in a\n",
      "sequence form (a) partial hydrophobic collapse(s). Each portion may grow to a larger assembly\n",
      "with a native-like configuration or two or more portions may merge into a larger block to form\n",
      "a native-like configuration. Such regions assemble to form a folding transition state. Then, the\n",
      "final native structure emerges very quickly. The ultimate goal is to learn how a protein folds\n",
      "into a complicated fold via above scenario. Thus we would like to know which parts of the\n",
      "sequence form the native-like 3D configurations in the early stage of folding. These parts may\n",
      "correspond to a 3D structural formation portion at the folding transition state. In the present\n",

      "In our experiences so far, a protein in the T4-phage lysozyme family consists of two well-\n",

      "One clear folding unit and a short relatively weak one are predicted for a protein in the globin\n",

      "folding units, and this is interpreted to mean that these two portions merge into a larger block\n",
      "in the protein and form a native-like structure (Ishizuka & Kikuchi, 2011). Thus, it is interesting\n",
      "to see how our method predicts for the sequence of a (β/α) barrel protein and how its folding\n",
      "process can be interpreted from the predictions. It is also observed that location of such\n",
      "predicted regions is robust among evolutionally related proteins (Kawai & Kikuchi,\n",

      "symmetry may be rather different from other folds. The present analyses along with the\n",
      "preceding investigations (Lang et al., 2000; Höcker et al., 2001; Richter et al., 2010) imply\n",
      "that (βα)8 proteins such as HisF and HisA consist of four independent (βα)2 units and\n",
      "these proteins start to fold at each (βα)2 unit. However, huge number of proteins with the\n",
      "(βα)8 fold exist, so the folding mechanisms of (βα)8 proteins may show wide variations.\n",
      "Actually, various folding mechanisms of (βα)8 proteins have been reported (Akanuma &\n",

      "and third common folding units in HisF and HisA. We will perform ADM analyses on\n",
      "additional (βα)8 proteins.\n",
      "As mentioned in the Introduction, the folding scenario of proteins may be put in the\n",

      "one folding core in the sequence (Kikuchi et al, 1988; Kikuchi, 2008).\n",
      "2.    A protein composed by two (or more) distinct domains\n",
      "Two (or more) portions in the sequence of a protein start simultaneously to form\n",
      "hydrophobic collapses, and these parts grow independently to domains in the native\n",
      "structure. T4-lysozyme, papain and so on belong to this category (Kikuchi et al, 1988; Kawai,\n",

      "Complex I, or NADH-oxidoreductase, is the largest and the most sophisticated segment in\n",
      "the respiratory chain; its architecture, functioning and mechanisms of ROS generation has\n",
      "been extensively studied (Magnitsky et al. 2002; Vinogradov 2008). In mammals it consists\n",
      "of 47 subunits with a number of redox centers to transfer electrons. Among them, there are\n",
      "flavine mononucleotide at the entrance of the Complex, which binds NADH, several sulfur-\n",
      "iron clusters and several Coenzyme Q binding sites in the middle of the Complex.\n",
      "According to the current consensus, all inhibitors, which bind to subunits located in the\n",
      "middle of Complex I and block electron flow within the complex, such as rotenone,\n",
      "piericidin and others, increase ROS (Grivennikova and Vinogradov 2006). The only known\n",
      "inhibitor that decreases ROS generation in Complex I is diphenylene iodonium, which binds\n",
      "at the very entrance at the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) site (Liu, Fiskum, and Schubert\n",
      "2002). This compound, though, is unspecific and also inhibits NAH(P)H oxidase of the\n",
      "plasma membrane. In other words, if an inhibitor blocks the very entry of Complex I at the\n",
      "site of FMN and prevents the access of electrons into Complex I at all, it would prevent ROS\n",

      "allows redox centers upstream of the block to be over-reduced, it would result in an increase\n",
      "of ROS (Genova et al. 2003). In accordance with this notion, inhibitory effects of diphenylene\n",
      "iodonium on ROS induced by hyperglycemia in MIN-6 cells were reported by (Tsubouchi et\n",
      "al. 2005), though the researchers attributed this fact solely to the plasma membrane\n",
      "NAD(P)H oxidase inhibition. Regarding the other Complex I inhibitors, there is some\n",
      "controversy in the literature. The same authors reported no effect of rotenone, the effect\n",
      "could be expected if ROS was already increased, while earlier work by Sakai and\n",
      "collaborators reported that rotenone twofold decreased hyperglycemia-induced ROS in\n",
      "human islets and MIN-6 cells (Sakai et al. 2003).\n",
      "There is a way to modulate mitochondrial ROS generation without interference into the\n",
      "activity of respiratory Complexes. In the cell this function belongs to a special group of\n",

      "shown that overexpression of UCP2 downregulated the levels of ROS (Pi et al. 2009;\n",
      "Affourtit, Jastroch, and Brand 2011).\n",
      "The same effect can be achieved by using chemical compounds called uncouplers, which,\n",
      "while different in structure, have two properties in common: they can penetrate into\n",

      "Senescence is a ubiquitous developmental process that leads to the death of a cell, an organ,\n",
      "or an organism and occurs at the final stage of their development. There is a striking\n",
      "divergence and convergence between plants and animals regarding senescence regulation\n",
      "(Kenyon, 2001). The mechanisms of regulation of ageing in animals including p53,\n",
      "telomerase and telomere dynamics, DNA damage sensing and repair, and transcriptional\n",
      "activation and inactivation by histone acetylation/deacetylation are either not present or do\n",
      "not appear to play an important role in plant ageing. On the contrary, plants have evolved\n",
      "their own unique senescence-regulating mechanisms. These include the modulation of\n",
      "senescence by phytohormones, photosynthetic machinery, and protein degradation. In\n",
      "plants, the chloroplast is reported to be the first origin and target for initiating senescence\n",
      "(Misra and Biswal, 1980, 1981; 1982a, b, c, Biswal et al., 2001; Dilnawaz et al. 2001; Misra et\n",
      "al. 2011a), whereas in animals the mitochondrion serves as the initiator (Thomas, 2002).\n",
      "Thus, we may infer that plants and animals have evolved conserved strategies for the\n",
      "regulation of senescence, while employing diverse molecular mechanisms that have been\n",
      "shaped during the long history of evolution. Senescence is a genetically-controlled\n",
      "developmental programme, but it has no adaptive advantages in animals, except that in\n",
      "plants leaf senescence is a recruited nutrient recycle programme and hence is considered to\n",
      "have a strong adaptive advantage (Bleecker, 1998). This is the final developmental phase of\n",
      "a leaf which starts with nutrient salvage and ends with cell death. However, until late in\n",
      "senescence the process requires cell viability and is often reversible (Thomas et al., 2003).\n",
      "There has been some debate about the degree of overlap of senescence and PCD (Thomas et\n",
      "al., 2003; van Doorn & Woltering, 2004, 2008). van Doorn & Woltering (2004, 2008) identified\n",

      "isoprenoid quinones, ubiquinones (UQs) and menaquinones (MKs) have been extensively\n",
      "studied to reveal not only their physiological functions but also their biosynthesis at gene level.\n",
      "In molecular structure, both UQs and MKs consist of a polar head group and a hydrophobic\n",
      "side chain. The latter part provides the molecules with a lipid-soluble character to allow them\n",
      "to perform vital functions in membrane lipid bilayers, whereas the former group enables\n",
      "interaction with membrane proteins. The quinone ring of the head group has a crucial activity\n",
      "by a two-step reversible reduction reaction to form a quinol structure (Fig. 1). There are three\n",

      "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are members of a large gene family encoded by\n",
      "approximately 1000 members (Lefkowitz, 2007; Pierce et al., 2002). They are also known as\n",
      "seven transmembrane domain (7TM) receptors as they are characterized by a single\n",
      "polypeptide that has seven membrane spanning helical domains. Members of this family\n",
      "include receptors that bind to biogenic amines, chemokines, opioids, lipids, among many\n",
      "more. They mediate a wide variety of physiological processes ranging from\n",
      "neurotransmission, cardiovascular function, leukocyte chemotaxis and analgesia. GPCRs are\n",
      "important clinically as many have been implicated in many diseases and are targets for\n",
      "approximately 50% of all marketed medicines (Drews, 2000).\n",
      "Upon binding to their cognate ligands GPCRs mediate down stream signaling via\n",
      "heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G protein). G proteins are comprised of an -subunit\n",
      "(G) and a tightly associated dimer of  and -subunits (G). In the inactive state G is bound\n",
      "to GDP and exists in an inactive conformation. Once the GPCR is activated by its cognate\n",
      "ligand, conformational changes in the receptor induce the exchange of GDP for GTP on G\n",
      "leading to its activation and dissociation from the  subunits. The activated G (G-GTP) and\n",
      "dissociated  subunits activate downstream effector molecules contributing to GPCR\n",
      "signaling. One effector molecule is adenylyl cyclase and upon its activation it leads to the\n",
      "production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which in turn activates the protein kinase A (PKA), a\n",
      "serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates many different substrates. Another effector\n",
      "molecule that is activated is phospholipase C, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl\n",
      "4,5 bisphosphate to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacyclglycerol, which in turn\n",
      "leads to calcium release from intracellular stores and activation of protein kinase C,\n",
      "respectively. Recently, it has become apparent that GPCRs may also signal independent of the\n",
      "G protein, and this typically involves proteins known as -arrestins (DeWire et al., 2007).\n",
      "To ensure that signals are of the appropriate magnitude and duration GPCR signaling is\n",
      "tightly regulated. This is critical because perturbations in the regulatory processes that control\n",
      "GPCR signaling may contribute to the cause of human pathologies (Hernandez et al., 2003).\n",

      "nervous system by acting on hypothalamic neurons through its interaction with the long\n",
      "form of its receptor, ObRb. This binding leads to increased expression of α-melanocyte\n",
      "stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a potent appetite inhibitor. However, leptin has also been\n",

      "the pancreas (Kahn et al., 2005; Morioka et al., 2007). The distention of the stomach following\n",
      "a meal can lead to increased leptin secretion by adipocytes, thus controlling appetite and\n",
      "energy storage, consistent with its effect as a satiety factor. It was recently demonstrated that\n",

      "various conditions (Chipman, 1993; Jorgensen & Christiansen, 1993). However, GH\n",
      "replacement therapy encounters several drawbacks such as low bioavailability and side effects\n",
      "upon its administration. Moreover, most growth hormone-deficient individuals exhibit a\n",
      "secretory defect rather than a primary deficiency in the production of growth hormone.\n",
      "A synthetic hexapeptide, His-D-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2 (GHRP-6), was identified as a\n",
      "potent stimulator on GH release in vitro and in vivo by an unknown mechanism (Bowers et\n",
      "al., 1984). Because of its poor oral bioavailability and short half-life in human serum, GHRP-\n",
      "6 was selected only as a structural model to design non-peptide mimetics (Bowers et al.,\n",
      "1992). However, as a peptide, GHRP-6 did not readily lend itself to optimization of\n",
      "pharmacokinetic properties by medicinal chemistry. The benzodiazepine like template\n",
      "containing aromatic substitution was therefore discovered as potential non-peptide\n",
      "structure to model the GHRP-6 structure (Bowers et al., 1980). Based on the structure-\n",
      "activity relation, a non-peptidyl GH secretagogue L-692, 429, was identified. This non-\n",

      "In vertebrates, the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM/CD56) has 3 isoforms resulting\n",

      "the membrane. Whereas NCAM120 is glycophosphatidyl inositol anchored, NCAM140 and\n",
      "NCAM180 are transmembrane molecules. NCAM180 has an additional intracellular 267 amino\n",
      "acids insert, that differentiate it from NCAM140, but its role remains to be fully elucidated.\n",
      "There are differences regarding the specificity and the level of expression of these isoforms in\n",
      "different cells of the nervous system. Whereas NCAM120 and NCAM140 are preferentially\n",
      "expressed in glial cells NCAM180 seems to be prevalent on neurons. Although differences in\n",
      "expression and function of the NCAM isoforms exist, one common denominator is that they\n",
      "can be post-translationally modified by the addition of long, linear chains of α2,8-linked N-\n",
      "acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) residues. In vertebrates, NCAM is the major acceptor of this\n",

      "proves the model of Caco-2 cell growth. Using the HMDSZ of plasma-polymerized film and\n",
      "photo-induced polymerization of AAm is a feasible way to improve the hydrophilicity of\n",
      "silver electrodes. The proposed modification method involves binding a protective film. The\n",
      "longer the plasma-polymerized reaction time, the greater the film deposition and thickness\n",
      "have. An increased film thickness extends the film protection effect of sliver electrode, the\n",
      "HMDSZ film extends the unpeeling time of silver electrodes from 1 to 7 days. The cell\n",
      "growth experiments in the current study show no difference between amine groups or\n",
      "hydroxyl groups. However, the AAm-treated electrode offered better protection than the\n",

      "QCM as Cell-Based Biosensor                                                                 431\n",
      "AAc-treated electrode. In summary, the experiment results of this study prove the feasibility\n",
      "of using a treated silver electrode QCM to detect cells.\n",
      "During the process of cell growth and tight junction formation, this system detected\n",
      "frequency changes based on QCM reactions with different solutions. Results suggest that\n",
      "cells stay close together when the amount of frequency change is below 100 Hz. The method\n",
      "is comparable to, but more versatile and convenient than, the TEER. The result showed that\n",
      "the QCM and TEER detection system gave similar results with respect to cells over time.\n",
      "This detection system makes it possible to detect the tight junction of Caco-2 cells and can be\n",
      "used for other cell detection in the future.\n",
      "We developed a cell-based QCM measurement system for long-term monitoring cell growth\n",
      "in this study. This system provides an investigation of cell adhesion, proliferation, and death\n",
      "process. The cell growth conditions, medium composition and other factors will influence\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "There are many thousand kinds of proteins with different properties and functions in a cell.\n",
      "To study a protein, one has to obtain the highly purified intact form of the protein. A major\n",
      "protein is not so difficult to be purified while a minor one may need many purification steps\n",
      "and high skills on the techniques. This chapter describes the principles underlying\n",
      "techniques for separation and purification of proteins extracted from cells and tissues. The\n",
      "strategy involves extraction and purification.\n",
      "2. Extraction of protein\n",
      "Generally both extraction and purification processes should be done under a cold\n",
      "condition, mostly at 0-4oC, except for some proteins. An ice box or another cooling system\n",
      "is normally needed for sample cooling. The extraction procedure varies according to the\n",
      "type of sample and physicochemical properties of the protein. The first step is to disrupt\n",
      "cells or tissues. The more gentle procedure is used the more intact protein is obtained.\n",
      "Most of animal cells and tissues are soft and easy to break, so gentle methods can be\n",
      "applied. For bacteria, fungi and most plant cells which have tough cell envelope, more\n",
      "vigorous procedures are required. Extraction buffer or solvent is also important. Buffer\n",
      "with suitable concentration, ionic strength, and pH is used for extraction of water-soluble\n",
      "protein. In some case, mild detergent or other appropriate dissociating substance is added\n",
      "to the extraction buffer. Protease inhibitors are sometimes necessary to prevent\n",
      "destruction of the extracted proteins by proteases. From the fact that the protein extract\n",
      "obtained from subcellular component has contaminants less than that obtained from\n",
      "whole cell and will be easier to be purified. So separation of subcellular components may\n",
      "be done before the protein extraction. Disruption of cells should be adjusted to get intact\n",
      "sub-cellular components. The required cell component is obtained by centrifugation\n",
      "under appropriate condition.\n",
      "2.1 Extraction of water-soluble protein from animal cells and tissues\n",
      "The proteins which are components of fragile unicellular tissues such as animal blood\n",
      "cells can be extracted by using hypotonic buffer solution. If the sample contains different\n",
      "types of cells, separation of the cell types before the extraction will make the purification\n",
      "easier. This osmosis-based method is also used for animal cells grown in culture media. In\n",

      "some case a mild surfactant is included in the extraction buffer. Sonication or freeze/thaw\n",
      "cycle or a mild mechanical agitation may be used to help disruption of the cells and\n",
      "dissociation of the cellular components. For multicellular soft tissue, a hand homogenizer\n",
      "(Fig. 1) or an electrical one with optimal size is a good choice. The tiny pestle using with a\n",
      "micro-centrifuge tube is also commercially available for the sample with a small volume.\n",
      "Equipments with stronger breaking power such as a blade blender are needed for\n",
      "extraction of proteins from tougher tissue such as animal muscle. Cell disruption by\n",
      "nitrogen decompression is another method for animal cells and some plant cells. In this\n",
      "method, large quantities of nitrogen are dissolved in the cells under high pressure in a\n",
      "vessel. When the pressure is suddenly released, the dissolved nitrogen becomes bubbles.\n",
      "The expanding bubbles cause rupture of the cell. Intact organelles are also obtained by\n",
      "this method.\n",
      "Fig. 1. Homogenization of tissue by a hand homogenizer.\n",
      "2.2 Extraction of water-soluble protein from unicellular organisms\n",
      "This group of organisms includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and some algae. Their cell envelopes\n",
      "are tougher than those of animal cells. The stronger methods are needed for disruption of\n",
      "the cells. A simple method is to shake the suspension of cells, as well as spores, with small\n",
      "glass beads or the other kind of beads. If the collision with the beads is done in a blender,\n",
      "the method is called a bead mill. Sonication is another way to break the cells. The solution\n",
      "used to suspend the cells can be only an appropriate buffer, or with the addition of some\n",
      "enzyme and/or mild detergent. The examples of the enzymes are lysozyme, cellulase and\n",
      "chitinase. Nonionic and zwitterionic detergents, especially Triton X-100 and CHAPS (3-[(3-\n",
      "cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate), are commonly used since they\n",
      "are mild and have little effects on protein denaturation. To disrupt the unicellular organisms\n",
      "with very strong envelope, a high-pressure press apparatus may be needed such as French\n",
      "press, Microfluidizer processors. In these systems, the cell suspension in a suitable chamber\n",

      "and mortar actually works well with plant sample. If the plant tissue is too strong to be\n",
      "ground, rapid freeze with liquid nitrogen will make the plant more fragile. The frozen plant\n",
      "tissue is ground before shaking in the buffer (Fido et al., 2004). Some plant cells can be\n",
      "disrupted by the mean of nitrogen decompression.\n",
      "2.4 Extraction of lipid-soluble protein\n",
      "Most of lipid-soluble proteins are membrane proteins. These proteins may be called\n",
      "proteolipids which are extracted from the samples by using organic solvents such as a\n",
      "mixture of chloroform and methanol (Velours et al., 1984). An aqueous solution containing\n",
      "mild detergents such as Triton X-100 and CHAPS is an alternative way to dissolve the\n",
      "proteins from cells or organelles. Strong detergents can be used but they may cause\n",
      "permanent denaturation of the proteins.\n",
      "2.5 Extraction of aggregated protein\n",
      "High expression of recombinant proteins in bacterial host cell often form insoluble\n",
      "aggregates which is known as inclusion bodies. This form of proteins is very difficult to\n",
      "be solubilized. To extract any protein from bacterial inclusion bodies, strong denaturants\n",
      "such as 6M guanidine-HCl or 6 to 8M urea are included in the solubilizing solution. This\n",
      "solution efficiently extracts the aggregated protein. However, the extracted protein is also\n",
      "denatured and sometimes can not be renatured (Rudolph & Lilie, 1996). The other\n",
      "procedure is to use a mixture of mild detergents such as a combination of Triton X-100,\n",
      "CHAPS and sarkosyl. This method is less efficiency but more native forms of the protein\n",
      "can be recovered (Tao et al., 2010).\n",
      "3. Purification of protein\n",
      "To purify any protein, various separation techniques are used depending on physical and\n",
      "chemical properties of the protein. The purification process can be concluded as follows.\n",
      "Step 1. Crude extract of protein\n",

      "for commercial purposes. Regardless of the reason for wanting to purify an enzyme, the\n",
      "general extraction and purification procedures are essentially the same. However,\n",
      "depending on the properties of the enzyme, certain modifications of the methods must be\n",

      "purification presents major challenges associated with their low concentration, their\n",

      "serious and examples of how we tried to resolve this problem will be presented.\n",

      "cause the precipitation of proteins by removing water from the hydrophobic patches on the\n",
      "protein’s surface, thus rendering them insoluble (Doonan, 2004b). Another approach to the\n",
      "concentration of a cell extract is a fractional precipitation using a salt. Again ammonium\n",
      "sulfate is the most frequently used salt, because of its high solubility and the fact that the\n",
      "density of saturated solutions is less that of the protein. This allows the collection of proteins\n",
      "by centrifugation (Doonan, 2004b). The fractional precipitation is done by incrementally\n",
      "adding amounts of ammonium sulfate and collecting the fractions precipitated by various\n",

      "It is well-known that many proteins fold into unique 3D structure (Anfinsen & Scheraga,\n",
      "1975; Pain, 2000). The mechanisms by which an amino acid chain forms a complicated\n",
      "tertiary structure have been studied extensively (Sato et al,, 2006; Sato & Fersht, 2007; Sosnick\n",
      "& Barrick, 2011; Schaeffer & Daggett, 2011) but are still not understood in a comprehensive\n",
      "way (Bowman et al., 2011). It is well-recognized that all information on the 3D structure of a\n",
      "protein is coded in its amino acid sequence (Anfinsen & Scheraga, 1975; Pain, 2000). Hence\n",
      "we should be able to extract the information from the sequence. However, this is a\n",
      "significant, long-standing and unsolved problem in structural bioinformatics. Gross features\n",
      "of protein 3D structures or protein folds are characterized by some combination of\n",
      "secondary structural elements, and the ways of combination of secondary units are full of\n",
      "variety (Lesk, 2010). This situation does not allow us to construct a simple picture of the\n",
      "protein folding mechanisms. Among such a variety of protein folds, frequently appearing\n",
      "common folds, so-called superfolds (Orengo et al., 1994), are attractive targets for studying\n",
      "their folding mechanisms. The crucial point is that in general the fold of proteins tends to be\n",
      "more conservative than their sequences, i.e., sometimes proteins sharing the same fold show\n",
      "low sequence homology (Orengo et al., 1994; Jennings & Wright, 1993, Cavagnero et al.,\n",
      "1999; Nishimura et al., 2000). This fact implies the difficulty in approaching this problem\n",
      "using standard bioinformatics techniques such as multiple alignment techniques and so on.\n",
      "We have been investigating this problem for several proteins using inter-residue average\n",
      "distance statistics of proteins. The tool we introduced is a kind of predicted contact map\n",
      "constructed from the sequence of a protein disregarding the knowledge of its 3D structure.\n",

      "preceding investigations (Lang et al., 2000; Höcker et al., 2001; Richter et al., 2010) imply\n",
      "that (βα)8 proteins such as HisF and HisA consist of four independent (βα)2 units and\n",
      "these proteins start to fold at each (βα)2 unit. However, huge number of proteins with the\n",
      "(βα)8 fold exist, so the folding mechanisms of (βα)8 proteins may show wide variations.\n",
      "Actually, various folding mechanisms of (βα)8 proteins have been reported (Akanuma &\n",
      "Yamagishi, 2008; Gu et al., 2007; Silverman & Harbury, 2002; Seitz at al., 2007; Setiyaputra\n",
      "et al. (2011)). Such variation of folding may be related to the nonrobustness of the second\n",
      "and third common folding units in HisF and HisA. We will perform ADM analyses on\n",
      "additional (βα)8 proteins.\n",
      "As mentioned in the Introduction, the folding scenario of proteins may be put in the\n",
      "following categories:\n",
      "1.    A one domain protein\n",

      "one folding core in the sequence (Kikuchi et al, 1988; Kikuchi, 2008).\n",
      "2.    A protein composed by two (or more) distinct domains\n",
      "Two (or more) portions in the sequence of a protein start simultaneously to form\n",
      "hydrophobic collapses, and these parts grow independently to domains in the native\n",
      "structure. T4-lysozyme, papain and so on belong to this category (Kikuchi et al, 1988; Kawai,\n",
      "Matsuoka and Kikuchi, 2011). In this case, the ADM for a protein tends to predict the\n",
      "location of distinct folding cores corresponding to the domains in the sequence.\n",
      "3.    A protein formed by a main part with an interacting short fragment\n",
      "A main portion in the sequence of a protein starts to form hydrophobic collapse, and this\n",

      "Senescence is a ubiquitous developmental process that leads to the death of a cell, an organ,\n",
      "or an organism and occurs at the final stage of their development. There is a striking\n",
      "divergence and convergence between plants and animals regarding senescence regulation\n",
      "(Kenyon, 2001). The mechanisms of regulation of ageing in animals including p53,\n",
      "telomerase and telomere dynamics, DNA damage sensing and repair, and transcriptional\n",
      "activation and inactivation by histone acetylation/deacetylation are either not present or do\n",
      "not appear to play an important role in plant ageing. On the contrary, plants have evolved\n",
      "their own unique senescence-regulating mechanisms. These include the modulation of\n",
      "senescence by phytohormones, photosynthetic machinery, and protein degradation. In\n",
      "plants, the chloroplast is reported to be the first origin and target for initiating senescence\n",
      "(Misra and Biswal, 1980, 1981; 1982a, b, c, Biswal et al., 2001; Dilnawaz et al. 2001; Misra et\n",
      "al. 2011a), whereas in animals the mitochondrion serves as the initiator (Thomas, 2002).\n",
      "Thus, we may infer that plants and animals have evolved conserved strategies for the\n",
      "regulation of senescence, while employing diverse molecular mechanisms that have been\n",
      "shaped during the long history of evolution. Senescence is a genetically-controlled\n",
      "developmental programme, but it has no adaptive advantages in animals, except that in\n",
      "plants leaf senescence is a recruited nutrient recycle programme and hence is considered to\n",
      "have a strong adaptive advantage (Bleecker, 1998). This is the final developmental phase of\n",
      "a leaf which starts with nutrient salvage and ends with cell death. However, until late in\n",
      "senescence the process requires cell viability and is often reversible (Thomas et al., 2003).\n",
      "There has been some debate about the degree of overlap of senescence and PCD (Thomas et\n",
      "al., 2003; van Doorn & Woltering, 2004, 2008). van Doorn & Woltering (2004, 2008) identified\n",
      "three positions regarding the overlap in senescence and PCD. Some authors assumed total\n",
      "overlap (Noodén, 2004), but van Doorn & Woltering (2004, 2008) postulated that overlap is\n",
      "complete and senescence and PCD are synchronous. However a minority, argued that there\n",

      "and photo-energy transduction by plants for primary productivity on earth. Absorbed\n",
      "energy can also be transferred from Chl to oxygen, resulting in the production of reactive\n",

      "degradation can lead to the accumulation of phototoxic intermediates and ROS production\n",
      "(Apel and Hirt,2004; Pruzinska et al.2007).\n",
      "There is a stepwise degradation of Chl (Hortensteiner 2006) during leaf senescence or\n",
      "accelerated cell death caused by various biotic or abiotic stresses (Matile et al., 1999). Hence,\n",
      "leaf yellowing is regarded as an external symptom of programmed cell death processes in\n",
      "senescing leaf cells (Nooden et al., 1997; Hortensteiner and Matile, 2004). The first visible\n",
      "event during senescence is leaf yellowing (Misra and Biswal, 1980; Quirino et al., 2000).\n",

      "A decrease in nucleic acids occurs during leaf senescence (Misra and Biswal, 1982b). Total\n",
      "RNA levels are rapidly reduced along with the progression of senescence (Misra, 1993b;\n",

      "Isoprenoid quinones, which are found as membrane-bound compounds in almost all living\n",
      "organisms, generally have functions as electron carriers or antioxidants. Of the various\n",
      "isoprenoid quinones, ubiquinones (UQs) and menaquinones (MKs) have been extensively\n",
      "studied to reveal not only their physiological functions but also their biosynthesis at gene level.\n",
      "In molecular structure, both UQs and MKs consist of a polar head group and a hydrophobic\n",
      "side chain. The latter part provides the molecules with a lipid-soluble character to allow them\n",
      "to perform vital functions in membrane lipid bilayers, whereas the former group enables\n",
      "interaction with membrane proteins. The quinone ring of the head group has a crucial activity\n",
      "by a two-step reversible reduction reaction to form a quinol structure (Fig. 1). There are three\n",
      "Left, oxidized form; middle, semiquinone intermediate; right, reduced form; upper, semiquinone\n",

      "oxidized states of the quinone ring. The addition of one electron and one proton to the fully\n",
      "oxidized form results in the semiquinone form. The addition of a second electron and\n",
      "proton to generates the fully reduced form. When the semiquinone loses a proton, it\n",
      "becomes a semiquinone radical anion. The reduced form of isoprenoid quinones becomes\n",
      "more polar, and thus the quinol portion may be preferentially located in the boundary\n",
      "region between hydrophobic and hydrophilic micro-environments (Fiorini et al., 2008;\n",
      "Lenaz et al., 2007).\n",
      "Such chemical and functional features of quinones make them suitable mediators of electron\n",
      "transfer between different protein complexes in biological membranes. Most of UQ or MK\n",
      "molecules function as mobile carriers of electrons in membranes, but some of them are\n",
      "tightly associated with protein molecules to function in intramolecular electron transfer\n",
      "(Goodwin, 1977; Lichtenthaler, 1977). In addition, UQs physiologically possess an\n",

      "UQ-binding protein, which is not associated with succinate- and NADH-UQ reductase or\n",
      "the bc1 complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is involved in transport of UQ from its synthetic\n",
      "site to its functional site. Cui and Kawamukai (2009) reported that Coq10 binds to CoQ10\n",
      "and is required for 11 proper respiration activity in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These\n",
      "findings not only expand our knowledge of the regulation of UQ but also allow us to\n",
      "challenge the longstanding notion that UQ molecules are freely moving in the hydrophobic\n",
      "environment of membranes. Coq10 possesses 13 highly conserved hydrophobic amino acid\n",
      "residues presumably involved in the binding to CoQ10. The presumption was partially\n",
      "proven by alanine substitution of these amino acid residues, in which L63A and W104A\n",
      "caused defective respiration and growth retardation on minimal medium. A human Coq10\n",
      "ortholog has been shown to functionally compensate for a coq10 null mutant. Therefore,\n",
      "Coq10 seems to be crucial for respiratory activity in various organisms.\n",
      "Coq10 orthologs are also present in various microorganisms including E. coli, though their\n",
      "physiological functions remain to be established. Our preliminary experiments showed\n",
      "that an E. coli YfjG plays a function similar to that of Coq10 and allowed us to speculate\n",
      "that it interacts with UQ or MK to enhance the activity of electron transfer between\n",
      "dehydrogenase and ubiquinol oxidase. The alignment of YfjG orthologs in Gram-negative\n",
      "bacteria exhibited 11 highly conserved amino acid residues, which are partially\n",
      "overlapping with the conserved residues in Coq10 orthologs, some of which are involved\n",
      "in UQ binding (Cui & Kawamukai, 2009). A yfjG-disrupted mutant exhibited different\n",
      "properties in respiration activity of E. coli. Dehydrogenase activities of mGDH and NADH\n",
      "dehydrogenase and oxidase activity of ubiqionol oxidase in the yfjG-disrupted mutant\n",
      "were nearly the same as those in the parental strain. However, glucose and NADH\n",
      "oxidase activities were significantly decreased. Notably, the catalytic sites of mGDH and\n",
      "NADH dehydrogenase face the periplasm and cytoplasm, respectively. The mutation thus\n",
      "seems to affect the electron transfer ability between dehydrogenases and ubiquinol\n",
      "oxidase. Therefore, it is speculated that YfjG binds to UQ or MK to stimulate electron\n",
      "transfer in the respiratory chain.\n",
      "3. Conclusion\n",
      "In this chapter, first, we have shown the fundamental information on MKs including their\n",
      "structures, biosynthesis and physiological functions. We have also introduced several\n",
      "proteins intrinsically interacting not only with UQ-8 but also with MK-8 in E. coli. These\n",
      "proteins can associate with both quinones that have different ring structures and different\n",
      "redox potentials. In some cases, both quinones function as a mediator of electrons via the\n",
      "respiratory chain or as a sensor of the redox state of cells. In other cases, both quinones\n",
      "are incorporated into protein molecules and indispensable for enzyme activity. Such\n",
      "microbes that are capable of synthesizing both types of quinones might have evolved to\n",
      "adapt different growth conditions only by changing quinone, but not by changing the\n",
      "cognate protein(s). We thus notice one of ingenious strategies of microbes in utilization of\n",
      "the quinones.\n",

      "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are members of a large gene family encoded by\n",
      "approximately 1000 members (Lefkowitz, 2007; Pierce et al., 2002). They are also known as\n",
      "seven transmembrane domain (7TM) receptors as they are characterized by a single\n",
      "polypeptide that has seven membrane spanning helical domains. Members of this family\n",
      "include receptors that bind to biogenic amines, chemokines, opioids, lipids, among many\n",
      "more. They mediate a wide variety of physiological processes ranging from\n",
      "neurotransmission, cardiovascular function, leukocyte chemotaxis and analgesia. GPCRs are\n",
      "important clinically as many have been implicated in many diseases and are targets for\n",
      "approximately 50% of all marketed medicines (Drews, 2000).\n",
      "Upon binding to their cognate ligands GPCRs mediate down stream signaling via\n",
      "heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G protein). G proteins are comprised of an -subunit\n",
      "(G) and a tightly associated dimer of  and -subunits (G). In the inactive state G is bound\n",
      "to GDP and exists in an inactive conformation. Once the GPCR is activated by its cognate\n",
      "ligand, conformational changes in the receptor induce the exchange of GDP for GTP on G\n",
      "leading to its activation and dissociation from the  subunits. The activated G (G-GTP) and\n",
      "dissociated  subunits activate downstream effector molecules contributing to GPCR\n",
      "signaling. One effector molecule is adenylyl cyclase and upon its activation it leads to the\n",
      "production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which in turn activates the protein kinase A (PKA), a\n",
      "serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates many different substrates. Another effector\n",
      "molecule that is activated is phospholipase C, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl\n",
      "4,5 bisphosphate to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacyclglycerol, which in turn\n",
      "leads to calcium release from intracellular stores and activation of protein kinase C,\n",
      "respectively. Recently, it has become apparent that GPCRs may also signal independent of the\n",
      "G protein, and this typically involves proteins known as -arrestins (DeWire et al., 2007).\n",

      "arrestin-2, also known as arrestin-2 and arrestin-3, respectively) (Gurevich and Gurevich,\n",
      "2006a). Visual arrestins are restricted in distribution to the visual system. Arrestin-1 is found\n",
      "in high abundance in rod cells whereas arrestin-4 is found in cone cells. Non-visual arrestins\n",
      "are ubiquitously expressed and likely regulate the signaling of many GPCRs.\n",
      "The classical known function of arrestins, in conjunction with GRKs, is to mediate GPCR\n",
      "desensitization, a phenomenon in which responsiveness to chronic stimulation is attenuated\n",
      "(Fig. 1). Arrestins were initially identified in the visual system as a 48-kDa protein capable of\n",
      "blocking light induced signaling of rhodopsin (Wilden et al., 1986). Subsequently, -arrestins\n",
      "were identified and found to function in non-visual systems in an analogous manner to visual\n",
      "arrestins in that they blocked agonist-induced signaling of the 2-adrenergic receptor (2AR)\n",

      "Lipoproteins provide the means of transport of hydrophobic lipids in the circulation (Havel\n",
      "& Kane, 1995). Composed of a single monolayer of phospholipids surrounding a neutral\n",
      "lipid core, the primary purpose of these spherical lipid particles is to deliver two major\n",
      "classes of lipids – cholesterol and fatty acids (FA) - to the different peripheral tissues.\n",
      "Cholesterol is carried in the form of free unesterified form in the phospholipid monolayer,\n",
      "or as cholesteryl esters (CE) in the nucleus of the lipoprotein. FA are transported in the form\n",
      "of triglycerides (TGs), also found in the hydrophobic core of the lipid particles along with\n",
      "the CE. Proteins that are amphipathic in nature are found associated with the lipoprotein\n",
      "and are referred to as apolipoproteins (apo). They serve as cofactors for lipid-modifying\n",
      "enzymes and proteins, including lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, lecithin-cholesterol\n",
      "acyltransferase and cholesteryl-ester transfer protein. Apolipoproteins also serve as ligands\n",
      "that bind to specific sites of lipoprotein receptors, providing a means by which the\n",
      "lipoproteins are bound and then internalized through endocytosis via these receptors\n",
      "located on cell surface membranes.\n",
      "1.2 Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins\n",
      "TGs transported by lipoproteins can be either of endogenous or exogenous origin (Figure 1).\n",
      "Upon absorption through the intestinal wall, dietary TGs are repackaged by the enterocyte\n",
      "into very large TG-rich chylomicrons containing apoB48 which are then released into the\n",
      "circulation (Havel & Kane, 1995). These lipoproteins distribute their TG load to the\n",
      "periphery via interaction with the lipoprotein lipase (LpL) anchored by heparan sulfate\n",
      "proteoglycans (HSPG) on the capillary endothelium. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis\n",
      "of TG of the chylomicrons to free FA (FFA) which are then taken up by the peripheral\n",
      "tissues including adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. This process leads to a depletion of\n",
      "the chylomicron’s neutral lipid core, resulting in the formation of smaller particles called\n",
      "chylomicron remnants. These particles have lower TG content due to the lipolytic action,\n",
      "and are enriched in CE as compared to the original chylomicrons. During the\n",
      "transformation, these smaller particles acquire apoE and exchange other apolipoproteins\n",

      "upon its administration. Moreover, most growth hormone-deficient individuals exhibit a\n",
      "secretory defect rather than a primary deficiency in the production of growth hormone.\n",
      "A synthetic hexapeptide, His-D-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2 (GHRP-6), was identified as a\n",
      "potent stimulator on GH release in vitro and in vivo by an unknown mechanism (Bowers et\n",
      "al., 1984). Because of its poor oral bioavailability and short half-life in human serum, GHRP-\n",
      "6 was selected only as a structural model to design non-peptide mimetics (Bowers et al.,\n",
      "1992). However, as a peptide, GHRP-6 did not readily lend itself to optimization of\n",
      "pharmacokinetic properties by medicinal chemistry. The benzodiazepine like template\n",
      "containing aromatic substitution was therefore discovered as potential non-peptide\n",
      "structure to model the GHRP-6 structure (Bowers et al., 1980). Based on the structure-\n",

      "Since its discovery in 1999, ghrelin has attracted a tremendous interest from both academy\n",
      "and industry. It has become one of the most extensively studied fields. This is due to its\n",
      "highly conserved sequence between species, its unique molecular structure, and the\n",
      "ubiquity of ghrelin and receptors which implicates its important physiological function\n",
      "during the development. The multiplicity of physiological functions of ghrelin are revealing\n",
      "gradually. Current evidences show that ghrelin affects GH release, food intake, energy and\n",
      "glucose homeostasis, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and immune functions, cell\n",
      "proliferation and differentiation, and cognitive behavior. Ghrelin is therefore a critical\n",
      "hormone linking the gastrointestinal activities with organism functions.\n",

      "Toxins promote long-lasting openings in the subconductance state that are barely observed\n",

      "the level of subconductance states (Chen et al., 2003; el-Hayek, Lokuta et al., 1995; Tripathy,\n",
      "Resch, Xu, Valdivia, & Meissner, 1998), suggesting that sequence divergences may control\n",
      "this subconductance level. Indeed, we observed that single point mutations in maurocalcine\n",
      "modify this subconductance level (Lukacs et al., 2008). The absence of long-lasting events\n",
      "with domain A might also reflect its significantly lower affinity for type 1 ryanodine receptor\n",
      "compared to the toxin. Second, in agreement with their potentiating effects on channel\n",
